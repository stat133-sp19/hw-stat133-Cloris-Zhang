The purpose of this workout is to create a shiny app that allows you to visualize—in an
interactive way—some of the saving/investing scenarios considered in warmup 6. The idea is to implement an app for the saving-investing modalities described in section 4 of
warmup 6. You can see the app here: https://cloriszhang.shinyapps.io/Workout02/
